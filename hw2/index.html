		<p><strong>Use of GenAI: </strong>I have used ChatGPT to look up how to use functions in C++ such as for loops and initialization as Iâ€™ve had no prior experience with C++, so it was used purely to learn the language, and break down any concepts I may have had difficulties understanding on a high level.</p>


		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Overall, I've implemented various mesh alteration levels on the 2D and 3D level from lines to teapots and cubes, specifically building off of bezier curves and surfaces and using flipping, splitting, and subdivision to increase the mesh vertex count, and better smooth shapes.
			Additionally, I used implemented Phong shading using area-weighted vertex normals. I gained a deeper understanding of the modelling unit through this, and saw how surprisingly simple, but tedious this could be, and Phong shading was just nice to see implemented in general.

		<h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

		<h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
			<p>The Casteljau algorithim subdivides points along connecting lines, then connects those points, and repeats this procest, interpolating recursively to model Bezier curves.
				I implemented this by iterating through the steps n-1 times (assuming n given points), and perform the lerp algorithm given to us using vector multiplication and addition to calculate the intermediate points, before pushing it back into a list of vectors (points), and returning at the very end.</p>

		<h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
		<p>The Casteljau algorithm also extends to Bezier surfaces, where we can do the algorithm control points to define Bezier Curves (in the u direction), before performing the algorithm on those curves themselves instead of individual points (in the v direction), creating a "moving curve" with their n control points.
			I implemented this by scaling up the original 2D evaluation function to 3D, which did not change very much besides using Vector 3D instead of Vector 2D. Beyond that, I implemented evaluate 1D by calling evaluateStep n times and returing our final interpolated vector at the very end. I put it together by calling the 
			algorithm #(of control points times), which interpolates the bezier curves, and puts it all into a list of vectors, and then evaluate that at the very end (across the curves in the v direction) to get our final 3d vector after evaluating our bezier patch given the parameter (u,v).

		<h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

		<h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
		<p>
			I implemented the area weighted normals by iterating around the given vertex, going to it's halfedge, then twin, then twin's vertex, grabbing that, and then doing the same for the next vertex, finding the length of the vectors by subtracting those two vertexes each against the vertex we are calling the function on, cross multiply those vectors and add it to a running area count, and then repeat this process continually going through vertexes before our halfedge equals our original halfedge, where then we normalize the area by calling the .unit function on the area total and return the final answer.

		<h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
		<p>I drew out the image of flipping the edge on a triangle, and marked all the vertices, edges, halfedges, nexts, and faces 
			and labeled all of them, before going so and marking them all in code by calling variants of e0->halfedge()->(neededitem). 
			Once I had all of the variables, I went and set neighbors of all of the halfedges noted down, 
			both the primary ones of the flipped edges, as well as all of the "nexts", and instead of adding or deleting any references, I simply just reassigned them
			into the positions where we "should have" the "new edges/faces". After doing so, I then updated the vertexes and the faces explicitly. In all of this,
			I check if the edges or joining faces are boundaries, and if not, I do the above reassignments.
			There wasn't any interesting debugging tricks I used, since trying to run make and then loading in the teapot would cause the code to run forever and
			start to loop if I flipped an edge. I triple checked everything, and not finding a flaw in how I did it, i decided to reorder how 
			I assigned the variables, assigning all the half edges first before the edges (having done the earlier before), which caused everything to fix itself, so it likely was just a minor syntax error that got cleaned up.
			It was a very annoying debugging journey as it was unclear as to what was going wrong, having to use printstatements to see where the issues were coming from, before going in and cleaning up the variables to make them more readable, which likely led to cleaning up syntax errors!

		<h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>
		<p>I implemented this similarily to Task 4, drawing out all of the elements, and which elements would be added, before matching them up in code. I created several new variables, and reassigned the old edges and half edges to new variable names as needed for ease of clarity. Something I did have trouble with was incorrectly getting the position of my new vertex, since I mistakenly used the use formula and instead caved in my teapot. I also was a little silly and accidentally returned right at the beginning of the function so it took me an embarassingly long amount of time in my sleep deprived state to catch that, thanks to the TAs on staff.

		<h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
		<p>I implemented loop subdivision by first calculating the new positions of new vertices and old vertices, storing them within the edges and vertex NewPosition attribute. This was done using the equations shown in the spec.
			The function is made up of several separate for loops each iterating through every vertex or every edge in the mesh. 
			I additionally set every vertex and edge to false in their isNew Attribute.
			I then go through the current number of edges in the mesh, and split on each of those edges, ensuring I only split on the originally given edges without going into an infinite loop of splitting on new ones that are created as well.
			I then set our new vertex's new position from the calculated position earlier in edges then, to prevent any issues further down the line with setting all the new positions.
			I then flip on every edge that connects an old vertex to a new one, and once that's done, I have a simple for loop that just updates every vertex position with what's in their newPosition.
			I used print statements to help debug since I was having infinite forloop issues, and found the issue in my splitEdges where I had a minor pointer reallocation issue that was causing issues, + accidentally splitting on every new edge.
			
			Presplitting edges causes more symmetrical subdivisions as shown in the images, and flipping changes the direction the asymmetry points in.
			Generally, splitting makes more meshes/edges to conform to, which starts to smoothen and refine shapes while having less edges means it tends to be bulkier. Flipping tends to fix the more random look to the mesh, as shown in the spec image with the mesh looking rather jagged and random before flipping made it more ordered, as also shown in the images.
